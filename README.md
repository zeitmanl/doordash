This is a "DoorDash" page for an Italian restaurant.

The menu is retrieved from a SQL database, which makes changing things like the price or adding new items easier. The user can add items to their cart, which is at the bottom of the page. The subtotal, tax, and total are computed in real time.

This app was created in Eclipse and can be run in Eclipse. Simply add it to your Projects folder and run MVCFinal. This app requires mysql-connector-java-5.1.46 and javafx-sdk-21.
